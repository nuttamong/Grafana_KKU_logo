# Permissions

A permission is an action and a scope. When creating a fine-grained access control, consider what specific action a user should be allowed to perform, and on what resources (its scope).

To grant permissions to a user, you create a built-in role assignment to map a role to a built-in role. A built-in role assignment *modifies* to one of the existing built-in roles in Grafana (Viewer, Editor, Admin). For more information, refer to [Built-in role assignments]({{< relref "./roles.md#built-in-role-assignments" >}}).

To learn more about which permissions are used for which resources, refer to [Resources with fine-grained permissions]({{< relref "./_index.md#resources-with-fine-grained-permissions" >}}).

action
: The specific action on a resource defines what a user is allowed to perform if they have permission with the relevant action assigned to it.

scope
: The scope describes where an action can be performed, such as reading a specific user profile. In such case, a permission is associated with the scope `users:<userId>` to the relevant role.

## Scope definitions

The following list contains fine-grained access control scopes.

Scopes | Descriptions
--- | ---
`roles:*` | Restrict an action to a set of roles. For example, `roles:*` matches any role, `roles:randomuid` matches only the role with UID `randomuid` and `roles:custom:reports:{editor,viewer}` matches both `custom:reports:editor` and `custom:reports:viewer` roles.
`permissions:delegate` | The scope is only applicable for roles associated with the Access Control itself and indicates that you can delegate your permissions only, or a subset of it, by creating a new role or making an assignment.
`reports:*` | Restrict an action to a set of reports. For example, `reports:*` matches any report and `reports:1` matches the report with id `1`.
`service:accesscontrol` | Restrict an action to target only the fine-grained access control service. For example, you can use this in conjunction with the `provisioning:reload` or the `status:accesscontrol` actions.
`global:users:*` | Restrict an action to a set of global users.
`users:*` | Restrict an action to a set of users from an organization.
`settings:**` | Restrict an action to a subset of settings. For example, `settings:**` matches all settings, `settings:auth.saml:*` matches all SAML settings, and `settings:auth.saml:enabled` matches the enable property on the SAML settings.
